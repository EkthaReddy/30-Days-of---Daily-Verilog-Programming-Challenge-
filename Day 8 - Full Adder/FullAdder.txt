Daily Verilog Challenge - Day 8:FULL ADDER
==========================================

Description:
--------------
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of a full adder circuit. A full adder is a fundamental building block in digital circuit design, used to add three input bits and produce a sum and a carry-out.

Features:
--------

- Verilog Implementation:
The full adder circuit is implemented in Verilog hardware description language (HDL), making it suitable for synthesis and implementation on FPGA or ASIC platforms.
- Testbench: 
A comprehensive testbench is provided to verify the functionality and performance of the full adder design.
- Modular Design:
The full adder is designed using modular techniques, enabling easy integration into larger digital systems.
- Documentation: 
Detailed documentation is provided to explain the functionality of the full adder circuit and how to use it in your projects.


Feel free to clone this repository and use the full adder design in your digital circuit projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
