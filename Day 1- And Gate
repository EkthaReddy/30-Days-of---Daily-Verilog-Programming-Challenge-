#Day 1 - And Gate

In today's day 1 challenge, I used Xilinx Vivado to simulate the AND gate.

To familiarise myself with the Verilog programming in depth, I have taken the initiative to learn all three types of modelling, which are:
- Data flow Modelling.
- Behavioral Modelling.
- Structural modelling.
Along with testbench to verify the inputs and outputs.

Below I have attached my code for three types of modelling as well as the testbench for AND Gate.
