Daily Verilog Challenge - Day 3: NAND Gate
==========================================

Welcome to Day 3 of the Daily Verilog Challenge! Today's challenge is to implement a basic NAND gate in Verilog.

Objective
----------
The goal of this challenge is to familiarize yourself with the basic syntax of Verilog by implementing a simple NAND gate. A NAND gate is a fundamental building block in digital logic, which outputs a low signal (0) only when all its inputs are high. Otherwise, it outputs a high signal (1).

Simulation
-----------
- Open Vivado and create a new project.
- Add the file different file names to your design and testbench for your project.
- Run the simulation to ensure that the NAND gate behaves as expected according to the truth table.
