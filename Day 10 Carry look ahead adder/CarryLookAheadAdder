Daily Verilog Challenge - Day 10: Carry Look-Ahead Adder
========================================================
  
Overview
---------
Welcome to Day 10 of the Daily Verilog Challenge! Today's task is to design and implement a Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA) in Verilog. A CLA adder is a type of adder used in digital logic that improves speed by reducing the amount of time required to determine carry bits. This is achieved by generating carry bits in advance based on the input bits, rather than waiting for a ripple effect as in traditional adders.


Objectives
-----------
  
- Understand the concept and operation of a Carry Look-Ahead Adder.
- Design a 4-bit CLA adder using Verilog.
- Test and verify the functionality of your design through simulation.
