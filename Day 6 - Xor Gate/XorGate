Daily Verilog Challenge - Day 3: XOR Gate
=========================================

Welcome to Day 3 of the Daily Verilog Challenge! Today's challenge is to implement a basic XOR gate in Verilog.

Objective
-----------
The goal of this challenge is to familiarize yourself with the basic syntax of Verilog by implementing a simple XOR gate. An XOR (exclusive OR) gate is a fundamental building block in digital logic, which outputs a high signal (1) only when an odd number of its inputs are high.

Simulation
-----------
- Open Vivado and create a new project.
- Add different file names to your design and testbench for your project.
- Run the simulation to ensure that the XOR gate behaves as expected according to the truth table.


Happy Coding!
