Daily Verilog Challenge - Day 3: NOT Gate
=========================================

Welcome to Day 3 of the Daily Verilog Challenge! Today's challenge is to implement a basic NOT gate in Verilog.

Objective
---------
The goal of this challenge is to familiarize yourself with the basic syntax of Verilog by implementing a simple NOT gate. A NOT gate is a fundamental building block in digital logic, which outputs a high signal (1) when its input is low (0) and outputs a low signal (0) when its input is high (1).

Simulation
----------
- Open Vivado and create a new project.
- Add the file different file names to your design and testbench for your project.
- Run the simulation to ensure that the NOT gate behaves as expected according to the truth table.

Happy Coding!
