### Daily Verilog Challenge - Day 3: XNOR Gate
=========================================
Welcome to Day 3 of the Daily Verilog Challenge! Today's challenge is to implement a basic XNOR gate in Verilog.

#### Objective
-----------
The goal of this challenge is to familiarize yourself with the basic syntax of Verilog by implementing a simple XNOR gate. An XNOR gate is a fundamental building block in digital logic, which outputs a high signal (1) only when its inputs are equal.

#### Simulation
-------------
- Open Vivado and create a new project.
- Add the file different file names to your design and testbench for your project.
- Run the simulation to ensure that the XNOR gate behaves as expected according to the truth table.

Happy Coding!
