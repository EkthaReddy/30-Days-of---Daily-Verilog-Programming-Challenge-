#Daily Verilog Challenge - Day 1: AND Gate
Welcome to Day 1 of the Daily Verilog Challenge! Today's challenge is to implement a basic AND gate in Verilog.

##Objective
The goal of this challenge is to familiarize yourself with the basic syntax of Verilog by implementing a simple AND gate. An AND gate is a fundamental building block in digital logic, which outputs a high signal (1) only when all its inputs are high.

##Simulation
- Open Vivado and create a new project.
- Add the file different file names to your design and testbench for your project.
- Run the simulation to ensure that the AND gate behaves as expected according to the truth table.
