Daily Verilog Challenge - Day 3: NOR Gate
==========================================

Welcome to Day 3 of the Daily Verilog Challenge! Today's challenge is to implement a basic NOR gate in Verilog.

Objective
----------
The goal of this challenge is to familiarize yourself with the basic syntax of Verilog by implementing a simple NOR gate. A NOR gate is a fundamental building block in digital logic, which outputs a high signal (1) only when all its inputs are low.

Simulation
-----------

- Open Vivado and create a new project.
- Add the file different file names to your design and testbench for your project.
- Run the simulation to ensure that the NOR gate behaves as expected according to the truth table.
