Daily Verilog Challenge - Day 2: OR Gate
========================================

Welcome to Day 2 of the Daily Verilog Challenge! Today's challenge is to implement a basic OR gate in Verilog.

Objective
---------
The goal of this challenge is to familiarize yourself with the basic syntax of Verilog by implementing a simple OR gate. An OR gate is a fundamental building block in digital logic, which outputs a high signal (1) when at least one of its inputs is high.

Simulation
----------

- Open Vivado and create a new project.
- Add different file names for your design and testbench for your project.
- Run the simulation to ensure that the OR gate behaves as expected according to the truth table.

Happy Coding!
